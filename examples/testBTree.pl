=head1 Test the construction of N Way Trees using Zero assembler code.

=head2 Iterate over a small sequential tree

This example creates a tree, then loads it with keys from 0..$N-1 . Each key
has a data value of twice the key associated with it.  Iterating over the tree
produces the keys in order. The structure of the tree so constructed is visible
in the printed output.

The code to create and load the tree is written in Zero assembler.  The Zero
assembler language uses Perl as its macro preprocessor to generate the
necessary instruction sequences.  Executing Zero assembler code on an emulator
enables cross checks to be performed on the running code. Such checks include:
the number of instructions executed, whether each memory location is of the
expected type, whether each location has been read since it was last written,
or whether it is being updated with the same value again.

=head2 Iterate over a wider, larger random tree

This example loads a tree with a random rearrangement of the values from
0..$N-1 and then confirms that the tree so produced can be interated to recover
the original sequence before it was disarranged.
